                    <h2>THIS DISH ISRECOMMENDED BY EMILY ZHONG</h2>
                    <h4>When Emily was a child, she was diagnosed with an iron deficiency in her body. Spinach is a good
                        source of iron, but unfortunately, Emily finds it difficult to tolerate the taste of spinach. As
                        a
                        result, her parents often puree spinach as a filling for steamed buns. This not only enhances
                        the
                        appearance of the buns but also allows Emily to consume spinach more easily. The same approach
                        can
                        be applied to various other fruits and vegetables.

            <h3>STEP 2: When the water boils, blanch the spinach for 30 seconds, then
              remove it.</h3>

            <h3>STEP 4: Knead the flour and spinach juice into a dough. Adjust the
              consistency by adding more flour if it's too thin or more spinach juice
              if there's too much flour. </h3>

              holes, remove it from the container. Gently knead it to release any trapped
              air from the fermentation process, then shape it into a long strip.
