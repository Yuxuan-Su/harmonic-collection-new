            <h4>Vivian, hailing from Zhejiang, China, grew up enjoying tea eggs with their rich, aromatic 
              flavor and slightly salty outer skin. In New York, she missed this taste but successfully recreated 
              it with a simple recipe search. Tea eggs, a traditional Chinese snack, were first invented by the Han
              Chinese, and Yuan Mei, a Qing Dynasty gourmet, documented their preparation in detail in his book 
              "Food List in the Garden of Sui-Yuan."
