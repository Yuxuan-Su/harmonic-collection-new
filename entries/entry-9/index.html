            <h4>Yiran told me that Braised Beef with Potatoes (土豆炖牛肉), to be precise, originated from Hungary, which is 
              a famous Hungarian dish, and since then it has been introduced to the former Soviet Union, which has become a 
              model of the so-called "communist" life, and it has also entered into the homes of ordinary people in China, 
              which has become one of our Chinese homemade dishes. It has also entered the homes of ordinary Chinese people 
              and become one of our Chinese home cooking. This is the first time I heard this story.</h4>
